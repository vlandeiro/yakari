# Yakari

Yakari is an interactive command generation tool. Its user-interface is heavily
inspired by [transient](https://magit.vc/manual/transient/), an Emacs package to
build interactive menus.

Building a Yakari menu lets users discover CLI features interactively. This is
particularly helpful for complex nested CLIs (e.g. docker, git) but it can be
used for any CLI installed on the user's machine.

Yakari is **not** a tool to write command line interfaces from scratch (see
argparse, click).



# Origin of the name

Yakari gets its name from a Franco-Belgian comic about a young Native
American boy who can talk to animals. Much like how the comic's hero connects 
with wildlife, this tool helps users talk to command line interfaces.
