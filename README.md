# Yakari

Yakari is an interactive command generation tool. Its user-interface is heavily
inspired by [transient](https://magit.vc/manual/transient/), an Emacs package to
build interactive menus.

Building a Yakari menu lets users discover CLI features interactively. This can
be used for any CLI installed on the user's machine but is particularly helpful
for: 

1. complex nested CLIs (e.g. docker, git)
2. building a custom menu for your most-used CLIs

Yakari is **not** a tool to write command line interfaces from scratch (see
argparse, click).



# Origin of the name

Yakari gets its name from a Franco-Belgian comic about a young Native
American boy who can talk to animals. Much like how the comic's hero connects 
with wildlife, this tool helps users talk to command line interfaces.
